Found this excellent '1899 Cyclists' Road Map of the Philadelphia District' today. Produced by Geo. H. Walker & Co, from the [Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fd265).

I first spotted a glimpse of this map in [this great article](https://www.osprey.com/stories/vintage-cycling-maps/) from Opsrey about vintage cycling maps.  You can find a [high-resolution jpg here](), and an uncompressed version [on this page](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fd265https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fd265). 

If you have a few hours to spare, I highly recommend diving into the Leventhal map collection wormhole.  There's all sorts of cool things in there, like these [1800's aerial drawings](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82m038m) of a lot of New England towns.
