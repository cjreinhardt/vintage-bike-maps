Found this lovely '1899 Cyclists' Road Map of the Philadelphia District' today.  

I first spotted a glimpse of this map in [this great article](https://www.osprey.com/stories/vintage-cycling-maps/) from Opsrey about vintage cycling maps.  You can find a [high-resolution jpg here](), and an uncompressed version [on this page](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fd265https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fd265) from the Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library.
