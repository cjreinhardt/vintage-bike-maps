![Portland Bicycle Map 1896](/assets/img/uploads/portland-bicycle-map-1896.jpg "Portland Bicycle Map 1896")

Initially found on [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/dwbet8/tbt_portland_district_bicycle_road_map_1896/).  I found a higher resolution version at the Multnomah County library that prints out at 29"x26", you can download that version [here (8.7mb)](https://gallery.multcolib.org/download/file/fid/7642/full). They have a bit of historical info available [on this page](https://gallery.multcolib.org/document/bicycle-road-map-portland-district), here's an excerpt:

> Map for bicyclists, dated May, 1896, showing good, fair and poor cycling roads in the Portland area. The area covered is large: the city of St. Helens in the north, Cornelius to the west, Oregon City to the south, and Camas, Washington to the east. Circles on the map mark the distance in miles from downtown Portland. The left side of the map is a series of advertisements for local businesses, including bicycle shops and hotels. The map is marked Adopted by the Multnomah Wheelmen, and shows that organization's winged M logo. Visit City of Portland Archives for more information at <https://efiles.portlandoregon.gov/Record/10222795>.

The Multnomah County library also has a nice collection of cycling maps, [located here](https://gallery.multcolib.org/collection/bicycling).
